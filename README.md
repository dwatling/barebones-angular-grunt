## Barebones Angular Grunt ##

This is just a template for use in web projects that want to utilize AngularJS, Material, and Grunt. 

Feel free to use in your own projects.

Command-line tasks: 
1. _grunt_ - Builds the releasable product in target/web
2. _grunt watch_ - Watches for file changes and outputs to target/web and deploys to TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/ROOT (feel free to change this in Gruntfile). Deploys the mapped files for development use.
3. _grunt karma_ - Runs unit tests and generates coverage reports
